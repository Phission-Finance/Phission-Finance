# Phission Finance

Providing a market for transacting PoW-ETH and PoS-ETH heading into the [Ethereum Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/).

Our primitive allows users to split any ERC-20 compatible asset into Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Fragments. 

After the Merge, each Fragment is redeemable for the original asset on the PoW and PoS chains respectively. 
Trading of Phission-native assets is supported by Uniswap v2 pools that earn liquidity providers trading fees and token ($PHI) rewards.

Before continuing further into our repo, please read the [documentation](https://phission-finance.gitbook.io/)

## Audits

Although several of the contracts are forks of trusted smart contract from major DeFi "blue chips", and the primitive is simple, Phission is an **unaudited** protocol - please proceed at your own risk.
